# Project Proposal

## Project Title:
**CartRanker**

## What and Why?

CartRanker is a platform that allows users to rank and review food trucks across New York City. Users can share detailed feedback, upload photos, and rate their experiences. This platform creates a user oriented community where individuals can discover food trucks based on their personalized preferences. 

Food trucks are often small businesses with limited online presence and specialized schedules, making it difficult for customers to find their hours, menus, and locations. CartRanker addresses this by providing a centralized platform where food trucks can include up to date information, and users can easily find and explore trucks that match their preferences, saving time and effort in the food discovery process.

## For Whom?

CartRanker is for food enthusiasts, busy professionals, and tourists looking to explore New York City's food trucks. Our initial end users will be:

* Tourists visiting NYC who want to find the highest ranked food trucks quickly during their trip.
* College students and office workers with limited time, seeking efficient ways to discover food trucks that match their preferences.
* Foodies passionate about trying new food and sharing reviews with others.
* Food truck owners who want a platform to showcase their menus, operating hours, and engage with customers.

## How?

The main view of the system would display a map of New York City with various icons indicating the locations of different food trucks. Users can click on each icon to view the food truck's menu, hours of operation, and menu items. Additionally, users can filter by cuisine, location, and customer ratings. Users will be able to rate a truck on a 1-5 star scale and include relevant pictures.

Key features:
- **Interactive map** of NYC with icons marking food truck locations.
- **Truck details** including detailed menu, hours of operation, and dietary accommodations.
